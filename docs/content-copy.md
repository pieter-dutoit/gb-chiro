## Meet the Chiropractor

Hi, I’m **Dr Garret**, your local chiropractor here in Griffith. I’ve always been passionate about helping people feel their best, whether that’s getting you out of pain, improving how your body moves, or helping you get back to the activities you love.

I studied a **Bachelor of Chiropractic Science** and a **Master of Chiropractic** at Macquarie University, and since then I’ve worked with people of all ages, from kids and athletes to tradies, office workers, and retirees. No matter who walks through the door, my goal is the same: to listen, understand your needs, and create a plan that works for you.

When I’m not in the clinic, you’ll usually find me playing tennis, going for a run, or swimming laps. Staying active is a big part of my life, and I love helping my patients do the same, because life’s simply better when you can move well and feel great.

## Services and What to Expect

At GB Chiropractic, we take a holistic approach to your care.

### 1st Visit – Initial Consult

During your initial consult, we will take a thorough medical history, including details about your current and past concerns. We will then conduct a physical exam to help identify the cause of your problem, not just the symptoms you are experiencing.

Once we have a clear understanding, we will provide care tailored to you. This may include chiropractic adjustments, lifestyle advice, or other therapies designed to support your recovery and ongoing wellbeing.

### 2nd Visit – Report of Findings

During the report of findings, we’ll review how you’ve responded to your initial treatment and work together to outline a care plan tailored to your goals. Depending on your specific condition, it may take anywhere from a few sessions to several weeks of treatment to achieve optimal results. We’ll discuss your individual needs during our meeting, making sure you feel informed about the process.

Throughout your care, we’ll work together to monitor your progress, and your feedback will help us adjust the plan as needed to ensure you’re always moving in the right direction.

### 3rd and Further Visits – Regular Appointments

This is where we begin implementing your specific care plan, including scheduling your upcoming appointments and, if needed, coordinating with your healthcare team to ensure you receive the most comprehensive support.

- Spinal adjustments & manipulation: Improves spine alignment to ease pain and help you move better.
